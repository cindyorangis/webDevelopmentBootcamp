ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById("root"));

//CHALLENGE: Make this app work by applying what you've learnt.
//1. When new text is written into the input, its state should be saved.
//2. When the add button is pressed, the current data in the input should be
//added to an array.
//3. The <ul> should display all the array items as <li>s

//CHALLENGE: I have extracted the Input Area, including the <input> and
//<button> elements into a seperate Component called InputArea.
//Your job is to make the app work as it did before but this time with the
//InputArea as a seperate Component.

// DO NOT: Modify the ToDoItem.jsx
// DO NOT: Move the input/button elements back into the App.jsx

//Hint 1: You will need to think about how to manage the state of the input element
//in InputArea.jsx.
//Hint 2: You will need to think about how to pass the input value back into
//the addItem() function in App.jsx.
